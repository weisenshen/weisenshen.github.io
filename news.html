                <h2>Successful Herndon Workshop Concludes</h2>
                <p>Over 40 participants from across the United States gathered in Herndon, Virginia for the INSTANT II Follow-on Workshop from September 16-18, 2024. The three-day workshop featured presentations, breakout sessions, and collaborative discussions on the future of polar geophysical observational networks.</p>
                
                <p>Participants represented a diverse range of institutions and career stages, from graduate students to senior scientists. The workshop fostered important connections and identified concrete action items for advancing community priorities.</p>
                
                <p><em>"This workshop was essential for bringing our community together and charting a path forward for the next decade of polar geophysics research,"</em> noted one of the organizers.</p>
